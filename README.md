# 🚌 Public Transit Delay — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a **structured exploratory data analysis** of public transit delay data. The project focuses on cleaning raw delay data, engineering useful features, and producing clear visualizations and insights to understand when, where, and how delays occur. The workflow is organized into **two Jupyter notebooks** and a clean folder structure suitable for portfolio use.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- **Load and clean** raw public transit delay data and document data quality issues (missing values, types, outliers).
- **Engineer features** (e.g. time-based, delay categories) to support analysis and future modeling.
- **Explore** the cleaned dataset through well-labeled visualizations and short written insights.
- **Summarize key findings** in a clear, reproducible way that can inform operational or modeling next steps.

The repository is **clean, professional, and portfolio-ready**, with full analysis and visualizations in the notebooks.

## 📥 Dataset Source

- **File:** `data/raw/public_transport_delays.csv` — trip-level records with scheduled/actual times, delay minutes, transport type, route, weather, events, and congestion. The file is **included in this repository**.
- **Source:** [Public Transport Delays with Weather and Events](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/public-transport-delays-with-weather-and-events?select=public_transport_delays.csv) (Kaggle).
- **Coverage:** 2,000 trips (e.g. Jan 2023); columns include `actual_arrival_delay_min`, `route_id`, `transport_type`, `weather_condition`, `peak_hour`, `weekday`, and others. Missing values only in `event_type` (filled with `"None"` in the cleaning notebook).

## ✨ Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data cleaning | Assess missing values, fix types, handle duplicates and invalid entries |
| Feature engineering | Create time-based and delay-related features for EDA and modeling |
| Exploratory analysis | Produce 4–6 well-labeled plots with short insights |
| Key findings | Document main patterns (temporal, by route, on-time performance) |

> Run **`01_data_cleaning.ipynb`** first to generate the cleaned dataset in `data/processed/`. Then run **`02_eda.ipynb`** for exploratory analysis and key findings.

## 📊 Key Findings

Summary from the EDA (see `notebooks/02_eda.ipynb` for full plots and insights):

| Finding | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **Delay distribution** | Median arrival delay ~**13 min**; distribution roughly symmetric to mildly right-skewed, with most values 0–25 min and a long tail of severe delays. |
| **Temporal patterns** | Mean delay by hour and by day of week shows limited variation in this sample; peak vs off-peak and weekday vs weekend are similar (~13.3 min). |
| **Route/location** | **Route_12**, **Route_18**, and **Route_15** have the highest mean delays (~14 min); good candidates for operational focus. |
| **Correlations** | Delay correlates weakly with traffic congestion and precipitation; no single numeric feature is strongly linear with delay; categoricals (route, weather) may help modeling. |
| **On-time performance** | **~25%** of trips are on time (arrival delay ≤ 0); **~75%** are delayed. |

## 🧰 Run Locally

You can run this project on your machine using **Python 3.11** and `venv`.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
**HTTPS (recommended for most users):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/florykhan/public-transit-delay-eda.git
cd public-transit-delay-eda
```
**SSH (for users who have SSH keys configured):**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:florykhan/public-transit-delay-eda.git
cd public-transit-delay-eda
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Dataset
The raw dataset `public_transport_delays.csv` is **included in the repo** in `data/raw/`. No need to download it separately.

> 📥 **Original source:** [Public Transport Delays with Weather and Events](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/public-transport-delays-with-weather-and-events?select=public_transport_delays.csv) on Kaggle.

### 5️⃣ Run the notebooks
Launch Jupyter and run the notebooks in order:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- **`01_data_cleaning.ipynb`** — Run All to load, clean, engineer features, and save to `data/processed/transit_delays_cleaned.csv`
- **`02_eda.ipynb`** — Run All for exploratory analysis, plots, and key findings

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Larger dataset:** Re-run the same pipeline on more trips or a longer time window to strengthen temporal and route-level conclusions.
- **Modeling:** Use the cleaned dataset to predict delay (regression) or on-time vs delayed (classification); consider route, weather, and time features.
- **Export figures:** Save key plots from `02_eda.ipynb` to `figures/` and reference them in `reports/`.
- **Modularize:** Move shared loading/plotting into `src/` for reuse across notebooks.
